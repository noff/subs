[Caption by Mike R. at Y Translator] Abby, are you gonna go on it? Yes? I just might, like, pee in my pants or something. Russell, you gonna make it? Boy came up and tried to kiss me on the lips. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. >> What? >> Are you serious? [Music] Come on. Get up. Come on. Go make your beds. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Do we have to pack? No, we're not spending the night, but you have to get up, and get you chores done. Everyone has chores, and then we play. Today is the first day of summer vacation. Ahh! I'm so excited. And so we decided that we would do something really fun. The kids got all of their work done. [Music] But we are going to do something fun every single Saturday. Does that sound fun? Yay! He's yawning over there. >> "Oh, that sounds awesome." >> I woke up early. I woke up early. [Music] Okay, let me see this. That right there is "the Cannibal." Abby, are you gonna go on it? Yeah. >> It's so fun. >> Yes. I just might, like, pee in my pants or something. [Music] I was blocked – I was bonk. I was driving [indistinct] bonk. I was in the same place. And bonk – [Music] Did you guys know that Russell had a twin brother you'd never met before? So, I'd buy it. I'd buy it. Attendant: Is everybody ready? Here we go! [Music] RIDE ATTENDANT: After your safety restraints have been released – >> And enjoy the rest of your day at Lagoon. >> That was super scary. She didn't even scream. I kept expecting her to scream and she wouldn't scream. She was just like [gasps]. Did you like that? But Russell screamed. I didn't scream, but Russell screamed. You girls are so cute. We're here at Lagoon with the [unknown] family. We went to the Hogle Zoo with them a few weeks ago. And it's just so fun because each of their kids has a kid that matches up with our kids. So, all the teens ran off and they're doing their thing. And we're doing ours. [Music] That ride was amazing! Chad wasn't so bad. Not at all. [inaudible] the whole time. It was so fun. It was amazing. [Music] That was so fun! [Music] This is the worst ride! Here we go. Whoa! He's scared. Russell, you're gonna make it? I already like this ride! I already like this ride! I love this ride! You love it? Yeah, this is already my favorite ride! The next time we're going on this, I'm going on this the first time! Eve didn't like it. [Music] The last time we came here, Eve was so little, she was always trying to crawl out of everything. We – We had a couple scary moments when we came last time. Are we having fun? No! Did you like it? We decided to take a little break and cool off. What flavor of ice cream would you get? I got fudge tracks, moose tracks. I got cookie dough. And look, my mood ring totally changed color. Cool. I think every nine-year-old girl has bought herself a mood ring. Am I wrong? [Music] [inaudible] It means you've got poop on the back. [inaudible] It's like why, why are you playing with [inaudible]? Girls! Girls! Your mood ring indicates poopy attitude. Okay, so one of the questions that we get asked a lot is, "How are your kids at going into public? Do people recognize you where you go?" And Abbey has the story she has to tell you. I don't know if those guys knew me, though, but when you were in line for the bumper cars, a girl came up and started kissing my hands. And just now, a boy came up, a little boy came up and tried to kiss me on the lips. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. >> What? >> Are you serious? What? How old was he? >> Was he like younger than you? >> He was, like, three. >> Ah, that's just cute. That's just cute. What did you say to the girl, though, when you were in line? I didn't. >> I didn't say – >> You just let her? You just stood there? >> I just kind of, like, backed away from her. How old was she? Was she little, too? >> I think she was, like, Eve's age. Ah, that's so cute! [Music] 20 minutes later. So, I think the train broke down. We've been waiting for ten minutes. I think it's about ready to go, though. Yay! He moved! I used to like spinning rides when I was a kid, you know, the ones that go around and around. And now, time to puke my brains out! Kay, you guys. It's getting late, and the kids are getting tired, and they're starting to stink. So, we are going to take them home and put them to bed. Thanks so much for watching [Music]
