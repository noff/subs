Hey, guys! A random question. Have you guys seen a Mexican restaurant on the beach here? >> I think there's one a little down that way. >> It's this way, right? I figured. >> Yeah. >> Second question. I saw you guys walking this way. You look great, by the way. >> Thank you. >> Are you – I see you holding hands. Are you guys just friends or... >> No, we're dating. We're together. >> I thought you were gay for a second. Are you guys actually like together>>together? >> Yeah. >> Yes, we're dating. >> Okay. Well, on a scale of, like, one to ten, how serious are you guys dating? >> Um – I would say a ten. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> A ten? >> Yeah, we're dating, man. >> You're smiling. Are you sure it's a ten? >> I'm positive! >> Okay. Well, I just came from LA. I'm staying in Miami for a couple of nights. Do you want to, like, get drinks and –? >> We're really... >> Look, man! This is my girlfriend. Back off! >> I don't have a problem. Just asking her a question. >> It's fine. It's fine. >> Geez. All right. No worries. [REVS ENGINE] >> Now let's see if she comes back. >> Um, wait. Is this your car? >> This is my car. Yeah, why? Can you not lean on the window a little bit? There you go. Yeah. Thank you. What's up? >> I love Ferraris. >> You love Ferraris? >> Yeah. This is actually a Lamborghini. >> Um – Well, it matches my bathing suit. >> I know. It does. That's why I approached you is I thought you would look great next to the car wearing green. But, I mean, you're with him, so I get it. I actually gotta go now cuz my friends wanna hang out. >> Wait, what is your name, though? >> I didn't give you my name yet because you guys were, like, saying you were together, and you walked away. [CHUCKLES] So... >> Well, maybe, we could, like, get a coffee or something. >> You wanna get coffee? >> Yeah! >> Your boyfriend's standing right there, though. >> I mean, it would... It's just coffee. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> It's just coffee. It's not a big deal, right? >> I mean, I was thinking a little more than a coffee. But later on, maybe, after the second or third date. But if you're with him, that'll be a little awkward to do, right? >> I mean. >> Hold on. Let me get out of the car. >> Do you care? >> Yeah, I f***ing care. >> Okay, let me get out of the car. >> It would be just one date. >> One date? You have a boyfriend. >> I mean, I like you. But I can't really take you on a date if you're ... with him. >> No, I get that. But, like, I just... It doesn't... I don't see, like, why it's a big deal. >> Um, because we've been dating for the past five years. And you want to get in some random guy's Lamborghini... because it matches your f***ing bathing suit? >> Well, okay. I just actually, like, I've been thinking that we should take a break anyway. So... >> Oh, you want to take a break? >> Yeah! >> I just took you to Italy. You met all my family. Now you want to take a break. >> But, like, okay. I haven't been happy. You know that we've had issues. >> Okay, but there's... That justifies the fact that you want to get in some random dude's Lamborghini? >> You don't have a Lamborghini. >> Are you... >> Wait. What car do you have? >> I have a Benz. >> Does that bother you? >> It's not a Lamborghini. >> True. >> So, you're a gold digger, pretty much. >> I mean, look. No, no, no, no. Look, I still, I still like you. I would totally take you on a date right now in this car if you wanna go. But I can't do it unless you're done with him – like done. You delete his number right now. You guys do this breakup. [DRIVER HONKS HORN] It's okay. Just let her go. Yeah. You guys gotta, like, break up right here, you know what I mean? If you're cool with that, then I'm... All of this never happened. >> Is that what you want? You want to break up right here? >> I think maybe we should. >> "Maybe we should." Whatever. [INAUDIBLE] >> Is that cool? I mean, look, if you want to get in the car, just go. >> I mean, if it's cool with her, then here. Get in! Get in the Ferrari. Get in. >> Wait, wait, wait. Hold up, hold up, hold up. You are a gold digger! A couple of minutes ago, you were, like, on his arm and you said you've got a boyfriend. You said "no" to me. >> On a scale of, like, one to ten, how serious are you guys dating? >> Um, I would say a ten. >> Now, you see my car and it's matching your bathing suit and you want to go with me? That's your boyfriend right there. >> Okay, is this, like, are you guys serious right now? >> Yeah... I mean, you just broke up with him over a car. So, honestly, bro, are you done with her? >> Golddigger. You're f***in' – you're done. >> No! >> Okay. Hey, hey. Yo. Get in the car, coz we're gonna go to the club and find you a real girl. >> Get out of my house >> all your s***. >> No. no, no. Do not get in the car. >> Hey, put this shirt on. Put this on. >> No, do not get in the car. >> Put this on. >> Get in the car. We're gonna go find you a real girl. >> [Inaudible] >> We've been together for five years and you're just gonna leave me? Stop! No! >> Just like how you were going to leave me. >> No! >> Get the f* out of here, b**. >> I literally get like... >> You got exposed! Sorry! Adios! >> What the f*** [CAR SPEEDS AWAY] [Music]
